# Quality Study

Here are the samples used for human study for different attacks. 

There are two folders, resnet50 contains targeted attack samples for ResNet50 and resnet152 contains untarget attack samples for adversarially trained ResNet152.

For each folder, there are multiple subfolders for each attack settings as described in paper. Each subfolder has corresponding adversarial samples images. The images which have index from 1 - 100 are used for human preference test on Amazon Mturk.
